    "description": "Modern healthcare systems combine digital technologies, clinical expertise, and data-driven workflows to provide efficient and patient-centered healthcare. These systems rely on integrated platforms that support diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and follow-up care. With advancements in artificial intelligence, genomics, telemedicine, and remote monitoring, healthcare delivery has become more proactive, precise, and accessible.",
    "core_components": {
        "EHR": "Electronic Health Records store a complete longitudinal history of patient data, including past diagnoses, allergies, medications, lab results, immunizations, and clinical notes. EHRs enable seamless data sharing across hospitals and clinics.",
        "Telehealth": "Telemedicine platforms support video consultations, e-prescriptions, virtual monitoring, and chronic disease management for remote and underserved populations.",
        "AI_Systems": "AI-driven diagnostic algorithms analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology images, and patient histories to detect anomalies earlier than traditional methods.",
        "Wearables": "Wearable devices continuously capture vital signs such as heart rate, ECG, blood pressure, glucose levels, and activity patterns.",
        "RPM": "Remote Patient Monitoring solutions allow clinicians to track at-risk patients in real time, reducing emergency admissions."
