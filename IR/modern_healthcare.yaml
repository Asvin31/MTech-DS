healthcare:
  overview:
    Modern healthcare systems rely heavily on digital platforms, advanced analytics, and integrated
    medical devices to support improved patient outcomes and streamlined care delivery. These 
    systems enable real-time communication between patients, clinicians, laboratories, pharmacies,
    and insurance providers, creating a highly connected healthcare ecosystem.
  components:
    EHR:
      description: 
        Electronic Health Records store complete medical histories, diagnostic data, medication
        logs, immunization details, and treatment plans. They ensure seamless continuity of care.
      benefits:
        - Real-time data availability
        - Reduced medical errors
        - Improved care coordination
        - Faster diagnosis due to structured data
    telemedicine:
      description: >
        Telehealth platforms allow virtual consultations, digital prescriptions, and remote diagnostic
        support. They bridge gaps for rural populations and minimize hospital visits.
      capabilities:
        - Video consultations
        - AI symptom checkers
        - Remote triage
        - Chronic disease monitoring
    ai_diagnostics:
      description: >
        AI systems enhance clinical decision-making by analyzing imaging data, predicting disease
        risks, and supporting early detection through machine learning algorithms.
      applications:
        - Radiology automation
        - Pathology pattern detection
        - Predictive analytics
        - ICU risk scoring
    wearables:
      types:
        - Heart-rate monitors
        - Glucose sensors
        - Smartwatches
        - Sleep trackers
      role: 
        Wearables continuously monitor vital signs and feed data into clinical dashboards for 
        intervention when anomalies appear.
  challenges:
    - Increasing cybersecurity threats
    - High implementation costs
    - Fragmented data systems
    - Limited digital literacy among clinicians
  future_directions:
    - Precision medicine
    - Robotics and AI-driven surgeries
    - Patient digital twins
    - Genomics-based treatment pathways
