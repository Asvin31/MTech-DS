Modern healthcare systems are built on interconnected digital platforms that support patient care, improve decision-making, and streamline clinical operations. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) allow clinicians to access updated patient histories, allergies, vaccination records, and diagnostic results in real-time. Telemedicine services provide remote consultations, reducing the need for in-person visits and offering support for chronic disease management. Wearable health devices continuously monitor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and sleep patterns, sending alerts to both patients and care teams. Artificial Intelligence tools assist in early diagnosis by analyzing large datasets, identifying anomalies, and predicting risks. Despite the advancements, healthcare organizations face interoperability challenges, cybersecurity threats, and gaps in digital literacy. Proper integration, strong data governance, and modern infrastructure are necessary for a fully efficient system.
