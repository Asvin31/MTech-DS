The patient is a 42-year-old male attending the neurology outpatient clinic for follow-up of chronic migraine without aura. Since the last visit three months ago, he reports a slight reduction in headache frequency, now averaging six episodes per month compared with eight to ten previously. Each episode typically lasts four to six hours and is associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. He denies focal neurological deficits, visual field loss, or transient weakness during attacks.
Current preventive therapy includes propranolol and low-dose amitriptyline, which he tolerates well apart from mild daytime drowsiness. He uses oral triptans for acute relief and reports satisfactory response when medication is taken early in the course of the headache. Sleep hygiene has improved, and he has reduced caffeine intake as advised. Stress at work remains a significant trigger, and he is exploring relaxation techniques.
Neurological examination today is normal, with intact cranial nerves, normal motor strength, and no cerebellar signs. There are no red flag symptoms to suggest secondary headache, and prior MRI brain imaging was unremarkable. The plan is to continue the current preventive regimen, encourage regular exercise, and schedule a review in six months. The patient is instructed to maintain a headache diary documenting frequency, severity, and possible triggers for ongoing evaluation.
